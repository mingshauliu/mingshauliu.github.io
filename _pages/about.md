Hi, I'm Ming-Shau Liu, most people call me Ming! I grew up in Taipei and London, and I work on dark matter using a range of data-intensive methods, including Monte Carlo simulations and latent representations of neural networks. I'm interested in both collider and astrophysical signals that can help us understand the interactions of dark matter with the Standard Model particles.

I am a visitor at IAIFI, based at MIT, where I study dark matter using machine learning. I normally teach at the University of Cambridge as a supervisor DAMTP and the Cavendish Laboratory. Previously, I graduated from the University of Cambridge, where I did the undergraduate Mathematical Tripos with Physics and then the Natural Sciences Tripos Part III. I wrote my Master's thesis on the classification of bosonic dark matter using geometric effective field theory, based on the origin of the dark matter model's mass. 

I previously worked at Cambridge, CERN, and most recently, Harvard with Prof. Arg√ºelles on the constraints of heavy neutral leptons and their implications for the MiniBooNE excess anomaly.
